        <p>In 1990, music manager Benny Medina, along with his business partner, real estate mogul Jeff Pollack, decided
            to market a TV story based on Medina's life. Medina had grown up poor in East Los Angeles but his life
            changed when he befriended a rich white teenager, whose family lived in Beverly Hills and allowed Medina to
            live with them. Medina decided to use this part of his life as the main focus of the show. However, given
            that by then a black character living with a white family was a concept that had been done multiple times on
            TV, Medina decided to change the rich white family to a rich black family. "That way we could explore
            black-on-black prejudice as well as black class differences", Medina said in an interview for Ebony
            magazine.[4]

            Medina pitched the idea to Quincy Jones, who had just signed a TV deal with Time-Warner. Jones was impressed
            by the idea and arranged a meeting with NBC chief Brandon Tartikoff. Will Smith was well known by then as
            his music career as The Fresh Prince had put him on the mainstream radar, but he had come into debt after
            failing to pay taxes. <mark>At the suggestion of his then-girlfriend</mark>, Smith went to a taping of The Arsenio Hall
            Show where he met Medina by chance. Medina pitched the idea to Smith, but Smith was reluctant, having never
            acted before. Medina invited Smith to meet Jones at a party that Jones was throwing at his house in December
            1989. There, Jones handed Smith a script for a failed Morris Day pilot that he had produced and challenged
            Smith to audition for Tartikoff on the spot. Smith did so, and the first contract for the show was drawn up
            that night in a limo outside. Three months later, the pilot was shot.[5]

            The pilot episode began taping on May 1, 1990.[6] Season 1 first aired in September 1990, and ended in May
            1991. The series finale was taped on Thursday, March 21, 1996,[7][8] and aired on May 20, 1996.

            The theme song "Yo Home to Bel Air" was written and performed by Smith under his stage name, The Fresh
            Prince. The music was composed by Quincy Jones, who is credited with Smith at the end of each episode. The
            music often used to bridge scenes together during the show is based on a similar chord structure.</p>
