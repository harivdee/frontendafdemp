Greetings,

While I have multiple year experience with the Salesforce platform and managed to get my
certifications in the past, I have not been given the longterm opportunities I would 
like to strengthen my development skills. 

A perfect opportunity for me would be to work closely with a Senior developer so I can 
develop my programming skills organically within a project environment.

As for my previous experience I believe my CV speaks for itself, I have managed to work 
with multi cultural teams in all sorts of positions throughout the years applying different 
types of continuous development methodologies.

Please feel free to contact me if you find a suitable position. I am currently attending a coding
bootcamp in Athens, Greece finishing early January so my availability is highly dependent upon this
timeline.

Thank you,
George N Lardasa
